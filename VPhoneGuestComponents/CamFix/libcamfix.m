/*
 * libcamfix — optional injection hook for Camera.app (com.apple.camera).
 *
 * Our virtual camera has no daemon-side still or preview pipeline behind it,
 * so AVFoundation's own paths crash, throw, or render black. The hooks
 * installed by cfx_install_all_hooks substitute our own:
 *
 * 1. -[AVCaptureFigVideoDevice _setActiveFormat:...]: suppress the crash
 *    when the device is our virtual camera and the format argument is nil.
 *    Camera.app's session-preset → format lookup returns nil for our synth
 *    because no preset matches our published formats exactly. Substitute
 *    the device's first supported format instead.
 *    (Device/CamFixActiveFormat.m)
 *
 * 2. -[AVCapturePhotoOutput capturePhotoWithSettings:delegate:]: when the
 *    photo output is bound to our virtual camera, read
 *    the vphoned shared frame file and fire the modern
 *    didFinishProcessingPhoto:error: delegate with an AVCapturePhoto built
 *    from that frame; JPEG encoding happens client-side via ImageIO. The
 *    deprecated CMSampleBuffer delegate is the fallback, taken only for a
 *    client that implements nothing else. If this hook fails, the capture
 *    path falls back to the original AVF code path (which would re-throw /
 *    error out).
 *    (Photo/CamFixCapturePhoto.m)
 *
 * 3. The moment-capture trio (begin / commit / cancelMomentCapture):
 *    Camera.app's shutter path. For our virtual camera the original is
 *    deliberately never called — it throws — so AVF's state stays clean and
 *    subsequent shutter taps don't compound corruption.
 *    (Photo/CamFixMomentCapture.m)
 *
 * 4. AVCaptureSession's _setRunning: / _setInterrupted: guards and its
 *    isRunning / isInterrupted getters: keep a vcam-bound session live
 *    although no sample buffers ever flow through it.
 *    (Session/CamFixSessionGuards.m)
 *
 * 5. The AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer pump and its scan timer: push CGImage
 *    frames into CALayer.contents, since nothing feeds the layer otherwise.
 *    (Preview/CamFixPreviewLayers.m, fed by Preview/CamFixGraphTap.m)
 *
 * 6. AVCapturePhoto's -fileDataRepresentation / -CGImageRepresentation: hand
 *    back the bytes stamped onto the photos we synthesized.
 *    (Photo/CamFixPhotoSynthesis.m)
 *
 * 7. CAMStillImageCaptureRequest stubs for the accessors Camera.app's
 *    capture engine reads off a request.
 *    (Photo/CamFixMomentCapture.m)
 *
 * 8. AVCaptureVideoDataOutput delivery for vcam sessions whose capture graph
 *    never runs. (Session/CamFixVideoDelivery.m)
 *
 * Frames come from the vphoned shared frame file through the shared data
 * plane (Frame/CamFixFrameSource.m). Diagnostics go to the shared camera
 * media directory, written by cfxlog.
