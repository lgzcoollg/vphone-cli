// MISFixDeviceIdentity.c — answer the profile check with a chosen UDID.
//
// A provisioning profile names the devices it covers. misagent refuses to
// install one that does not name this device:
//
//     Failed to install embedded profile for plus.yellow.AirBuild : 0xE8008012
//       (This provisioning profile cannot be installed on this device.)
//       -[MIInstallableBundle _installEmbeddedProfilesWithError:]
//
// which is correct — a VM's UDID is not in anyone's `ProvisionedDevices`
// unless Xcode has just registered it, and Xcode can only do that for a free
// personal team. For a paid team the VM would have to be added to the account
// by hand, and again after every `vm create`.
//
// ## Where the comparison gets its UDID
//
// misagent carries the same UDID-query helper libmis does — its strings give
// the order outright:
//
//     amfi_emulate_device_udid / "Using emulated device UDID: %{public}@"
//     "got NULL when querying UDID" / "got non-string when querying UDID"
//     "could not get device UDID" / deviceUDID / UniqueDeviceID
//     ProvisionedDevices / ProvisionsAllDevices
//
// It first asks the kernel's codesigning configuration for an emulated UDID,
// then falls back to MobileGestalt. On a vphone600 guest the first path is
// dead: `amfi_emulate_device_udid` appears in neither the kernelcache nor TXM,
// so nothing ever publishes that key and the fallback is what runs. misagent's
// only imports that could answer are `_MGCopyAnswer` and lockdown's check-in,
// and MobileGestalt is where `UniqueDeviceID` lives.
//
// `MGCopyAnswer` is exported from libMobileGestalt, so the fallback is the one
// place a hook can stand.
//
// ## What this does
//
// When `/usr/lib/libmisfix.plist` sets `UniqueDeviceID`, a MobileGestalt query
// for that property is answered with the configured string instead of the
// guest's own. Every other query is passed through untouched. With no
// configuration the hook is inert.
//
// Point it at a device the team has already registered and that team's
// profiles install here, with no portal round trip and nothing to redo after a
// rebuild.
//
// ## How far this reaches, measured
//
// misagent, and nothing else. Its main executable calls `MGCopyAnswer` itself,
// so the interpose catches it and a profile naming the configured device
// installs.
//
// installd does not benefit and no interpose can make it. Its profile check
// runs MobileInstallation → libmis → libMobileGestalt, all three inside the
// dyld shared cache, and an interpose rewrites call sites in the images dyld
// links — not the cache's own. Measured on test-26.4 (2026-09-30,
// `libmisfix[726]`): one `devicectl device install app`, `LogQueries` on, and
// the only line from installd is `MGCopyAnswer(BuildVersion) from installd`.
// No `UniqueDeviceID` query, although libmis plainly resolved one — it skipped
// every installed profile with `0xE8008012` and then returned
//
//     +[MICodeSigningVerifier _validateSignatureAndCopyInfoForURL:withOptions:error:]:
//         80: Failed to verify code signature of …/AirBuild.app : 0xe8008015
//
// The signature itself was fine; the same capture has `cdhash: <private> is
// trusted`. libmis's other route to a UDID is closed too:
// `amfi_interface_query_bootarg_state returned error Function not implemented`.
//
// ## Why this is now a convenience rather than the fix
//
// Making a profile install was one way to get an Xcode install through. It is
// no longer the way this project takes: MISFixSignature.c validates the bundle
// on its own signature with `ValidatedByProfile = 0`, and
// MISFixProfilePolicy.c lets the embedded profile fail to install without
// failing the install. An arbitrary IPA then goes in with no UDID configured
// at all, which is the point — pinning a VM to a borrowed UDID only ever
// worked for a team whose registered devices you already have.
//
// The override is kept because it is harmless, already shipped, and reachable
// from the VM window's Device ▸ Set UDID…. Setting it makes profiles install
// for real instead of being skipped, which is closer to what the device would
// have done.
//
// ## The inconsistency this creates, stated plainly
//
// The guest gives two different answers about which device it is. What Xcode,
// `devicectl` and lockdown report is unchanged — that UDID is built by TXM
// before the kernel runs, out of the device tree's `chip-id` and
// `unique-chip-id`, and nothing in userspace can alter it. Only the processes
// carrying this hook see the configured value.
//
// That is deliberate. Making the two agree would mean rewriting
// `unique-chip-id`, which is the ECID the guest's SHSH blob is issued against,
// so the VM would have to be restored again — and `chip-id` is fixed at
// 0x0000FE01 by the virtual SoC, so a real iPhone's UDID could not be
// reproduced even then.
