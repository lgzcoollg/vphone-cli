// FirmwarePipelineOriginals.swift — The untouched copy of each boot-chain file.
//
// `fw patch` rewrites a firmware component in place: it loads the file, patches
// the payload, saves over the same path. Run it twice and the second run hands
// the patchers the first run's output, they find none of the shapes they already
// replaced, and the component fails outright — `Patch site not found: iBSS`.
// `fw prepare` refuses to re-extract over an existing restore tree, so there was
// no way back either: a VM could be patched once and never again, and editing its
// `PatchSelection.plist` to turn a patch off changed nothing on disk.
//
// The answer lives here. The first run copies each boot-chain file into
// `<vmDirectory>/FirmwareOriginals/`, mirroring its path, before anything is
// written; every run after that patches those bytes rather than the ones it wrote
// last time. `fw patch` is then idempotent by construction — same VM, same plan,
// same file on disk however many times it runs — and a plan that turns a
// component's patches off puts the unpatched image back instead of leaving the
// previous run's patches stranded with nothing selecting them.
//
// The stash is a direct child of the VM directory, never of the restore tree, so
// neither `findRestoreDirectory` (which matches a directory name containing
// "Restore") nor a component glob (rooted at the restore tree, or non-recursive in
// the VM root) can resolve a component to its own pristine copy.
