// CustomFirmwareCacheLoader.swift — open launchd_cache_loader's unsecure-cache gate.
//
// Swift port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_cache_loader.py`, driven today by
// `cfw.py patch-launchd-cache-loader <binary>`.
//
// What the binary does. `/usr/libexec/launchd_cache_loader` builds the XPC
// service cache launchd loads at boot. Before it will accept a cache that did
// not come from the sealed system volume it looks for the boot-arg
// `launchd_unsecure_cache=` in `kern.bootargs`:
//
//     adrp x0, "kern.bootargs" ; add x0, x0, #… ; add x1, sp, #…
//     bl   <sysctl-by-name helper>
//     cbz  x0, no_bootargs
//     ldr  x0, [sp, #…] ; cbz x0, no_bootargs
//     adrp x1, "launchd_unsecure_cache=" ; add x1, x1, #…   <- the string xref
//     mov  x2, #0
//     bl   <boot-arg lookup>                                <- the call
//     cbz  x0, skip_unsecure_cache                          <- THE GATE
//     …                                                     <- "Using unsecure cache: %s"
//
// On a VM there is no way to set that boot-arg, so the gate always takes the
// skip and the loader refuses anything but the stock cache. NOP'ing the one
// `cbz` makes the unsecure path unconditional, which is what lets a MODIFIED
// `/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist` be loaded — the only reason this patch
// exists (`Research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md`, "Allow modified
// launchd.plist"). A flavour that does not rewrite `launchd.plist` does not
// need it; see `cfw-kit/lib/base_stages.sh:stage_launchd_cache_loader`.
//
// Nothing is hardcoded. The boot-arg string is found by content in the Mach-O's
// own string sections, its ADRP+ADD xref is recovered from Capstone-decoded
// operands, the call after it is found by control flow, and the gate is the
// conditional branch that consumes that call's return register. The replacement
// is `ARM64.nop`, which ARM64Constants generated with keystone.
//
// Two deliberate divergences from the Python, both documented at the site:
//
//  1. IDEMPOTENCE. The Python is not idempotent. On a second run it walks past
//     the NOP it wrote and takes the *next* conditional branch — `cbnz x0,`
//     over the log-file `fopen` — so it silently re-opens and truncates the log
//     on every cache build. This port recognises its own output and stops.
//     `CryptexFilesystemPatcher.patchLaunchdCacheLoader` patches in place with
//     no `.bak` restore, so that second run is reachable today.
//  2. REFUSAL OVER GUESSING. The Python takes the first conditional branch it
//     sees after the call, whatever it tests. This port checks that the branch
//     really consumes the call's result and jumps forward out of the unsecure
//     path, and throws when it does not, rather than NOP'ing an unrelated
//     branch on a firmware whose shape has moved.
//
// Re-signing is OFF by default, which is what keeps this byte-identical to the
// Python: every shipped caller re-signs the whole binary afterwards (`ldid_sign`
// in `cfw_install*.sh`, `VPhoneSigner.sign` in the Swift call site), so slot
// hashes written here would be thrown away. A caller that does NOT re-sign must
// pass `reattestsCodeSignature: true` or ship a binary TXM will SIGKILL on the
// first page-in of the patched page.
