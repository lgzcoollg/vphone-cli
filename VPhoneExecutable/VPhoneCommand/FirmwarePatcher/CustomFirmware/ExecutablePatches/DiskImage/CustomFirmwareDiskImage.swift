// CustomFirmwareDiskImage.swift — force diskimagesiod's DDI mount-completion gate open.
//
// Swift port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_diskimagesiod.py`, driven by
// `cfw.py patch-diskimagesiod <binary>` and, in the shipped installers, by
// `scripts/cfw_install.sh:415` / `cfw-kit/lib/base_stages.sh:188`.
//
// Why the patch exists
// ────────────────────
// `pymobiledevice3 mounter auto-mount` attaches the personalized DDI, then
// MobileStorageMounter waits on diskimagesiod's
// `-[DIDiskArb waitForDAMountWithExpectedCount:diskTracker:]` before it
// performs the real (nobrowse) mount of the DDI volume at /System/Developer.
// That wait spins until `isMountComplete` returns YES, which is
// `callbackReached || (appearedDiskCount >= expectedCount &&
// mountedDiskCount >= mountableDiskCount)`. On the iOS-27-userland /
// 26.4-vphone600-kernel hybrid it never becomes true: only some of the DMG's
// IOMedia ever "appear" to diskimagesiod's DiskArbitration session, and
// diskarbitrationd never auto-mounts the volume, so the wait hangs forever and
// pmd3 times out. diskimagesiod itself does NOT mount the DDI — its
// `-[DIDiskArb mountWithDeviceName:…]` is dead code; it only gates
// MobileStorageMounter. Forcing `isMountComplete` to YES lets the wait return
// immediately so MobileStorageMounter proceeds and mounts the DDI.
//
// Pairs with the JB kernel patches that make the DDI attachable and mountable
// (the DiskImages2 ABI pokes, and the Sandbox `mpo_proc_check_syscall_unix`
// stub that lets MobileStorageMounter's `mount_apfs` issue `mount(2)`).
// No-op-in-effect on version-matched userlands, where the wait completes on its
// own and returning YES early changes nothing observable.
//
// How the site is found
// ─────────────────────
// Nothing here is a hardcoded offset. Two source-backed anchors, in order:
//
//   1. `LC_SYMTAB`: a symbol whose name contains `isMountCompleteWithExpectedCount`.
//      Shipped diskimagesiod is stripped, so this normally misses — it is kept
//      because it is the cheapest and most direct anchor when it does hit.
//   2. ObjC runtime metadata, which survives stripping:
//      selector cstring in `__TEXT,__objc_methname`
//        → its `__objc_selrefs` entry (chained-fixup aware)
//        → the relative method-list entry naming it
//        → that entry's `imp` field, relative-addressed.
//      `__TEXT,__objc_methlist` is walked *structurally* first — a packed run
//      of `{entsizeAndFlags, count}` headers followed by `count` 12-byte
//      `{name, types, imp}` entries, each list 8-byte aligned. The structural
//      walk cannot land mid-entry and cannot mistake a `__const` word for a
//      method. The Python's 4-byte-strided scan is kept behind it, over the
//      same sections the Python tries plus `__objc_methlist` itself, so this
//      port is never less capable than the one it replaces. Either way the
//      result is required to be the *only* entry in the image naming that
//      selector.
//
// The resolved IMP is then checked to land inside `__TEXT,__text` and to decode
// as real instructions before a single byte is written.
//
// What is written
// ───────────────
// `mov x0, #1 ; ret` over the method prologue. Safe: the function returns to the
// caller's (unsigned) LR without ever having pushed a frame, so overwriting
// `pacibsp; stp …` loses nothing that the new epilogue needs. Both words come
// from the encoder — `ARM64Encoder.encodeMovzX` builds MOVZ from its ISA fields
// and `ARM64.ret` is the keystone-derived constant; `CustomFirmwareDiskImageTests`
// asserts the two agree with `ARM64.movX0_1`.
//
// Re-signing
// ──────────
// Off by default, matching the Python and the call site: `cfw_install.sh`
// re-signs the patched binary with `ldid` under the extracted
// `com.apple.diskimagesiod` entitlements, so a slot re-attest here would be
// overwritten moments later. `reattest: true` recomputes the CodeDirectory slot
// hashes through `CustomFirmwareMachOCodeSignature` instead, which is what a caller that
// drops the `ldid` step needs — and what makes `codesign -v` pass on the patched
// file on its own.
