// CustomFirmwareDaemonsLaunchd.swift — LaunchDaemon injection into /System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist.
//
// Translated from: scripts/patchers/cfw_daemons.py (inject_daemons), and from the
// inline plistlib snippets at cfw_install_jb.sh:460-469 and cfw_install_exp.sh:702-711.
//
// Those three were the same merge written twice, once as a command taking a
// directory of daemon plists and once inline taking a single file. They converge
// here: `inject` is the merge, and the two loaders below are the only difference
// between the call sites.
