// CustomFirmwareMachLookupExceptions.swift — Campo backboard/frontboard mach-lookups.
//
// Swift port of scripts/patchers/campo_mach_lookup_exceptions.py (JB-3b).
// See Research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md #14.
//
// iOS 27's temporary sandbox denies Campo.app the backboard/frontboard
// services it needs to put a window on screen. The install step dumps
// Campo's entitlements with `ldid -e`, merges the missing global-name
// lookups into the mach-lookup exception array, and re-signs with the
// merged plist.
//
// The merge is append-only and order-preserving: entries already present
// keep their position, and anything the binary carried that is not in this
// list survives. That matters because the plist is fed straight back to
// `ldid`, and dropping an entitlement Campo already had would be a silent
// downgrade.
