// CryptexFilesystemPatcherFileOps.swift — the file operations that used to be subprocesses.

// chmod, chown, ln and find were spawned a dozen times between them to do work this
// process can do directly. What is here is not a set of convenience wrappers: each one
// names the tool and the flag it replaces, because the defaults are not obvious and
// getting one wrong writes a guest volume that only fails at boot.
