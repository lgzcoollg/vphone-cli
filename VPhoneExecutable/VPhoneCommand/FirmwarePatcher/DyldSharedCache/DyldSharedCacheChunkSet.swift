// DyldSharedCacheChunkSet.swift — Flat virtual-address access over a chunked dyld shared cache.
//
// The iOS 26/27 SystemOS cryptex ships the shared cache as many files:
//
//     dyld_shared_cache_arm64e
//     dyld_shared_cache_arm64e.01
//     dyld_shared_cache_arm64e.02
//     ...
//     dyld_shared_cache_arm64e.75.dylddata
//     dyld_shared_cache_arm64e.77.dyldlinkedit
//
// Every one of them carries its own `dyld_cache_header` and its own mapping
// table. The address ranges are disjoint across chunks, so together they are
// one contiguous virtual address space. This type is the translation from an
// address in that space to (file, offset), and back.
//
// It deliberately does not extract dylibs. Patchers want to read four bytes at
// a vmaddr, decide something, and write four bytes back; anything more is the
// symbol resolver's job.
//
// Port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_dsc_chunks.py`. The Python remains the
// independent reference for this layer — see `DyldSharedCacheFoundationTests`.
//
// Two places diverge from it on purpose, both pinned by tests:
//
//   * `bytes_at_vma` bounds-checks only its first byte and then reads `length`
//     raw bytes from the file, so a read near the end of a mapping comes back
//     padded with whatever follows — at 0x1800BBFFC on this cache, with the
//     chunk's own code signature. Here the whole span has to be addressable.
//   * `write_at_vma` compares only the chunk path, so it will write across a
//     mapping seam whether or not the file offsets continue across it. Here a
//     span may cross a seam only when the bytes behind it really are one run of
//     one file, which on this cache accepts every seam the Python accepts.
