// DyldSharedCacheCameraPatcher.swift — The two camera DSC patch families, EXP only.
//
// Port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_camera_dsc.py`, which stays the
// independent reference: the parity gate is the Python run on one clone of the
// real cache and this run on another, with the two clones compared byte for
// byte.
//
// Two families, six sites
// -----------------------
//
//  1. **NeutrinoCore short-circuit** — the five
//     `+[_NUStyleTransfer*Processor processWithInputs:arguments:output:error:]`
//     class methods become `mov w0, #0; ret`. Together with the DT
//     `/product/camera` node (`DeviceTreePatcher`), this lets Camera.app reach
//     the viewfinder: the style-thumbnail pipeline returns NO before it can
//     reach `_NUStyleEngineMemoryResource init…`, which asserts on a nil
//     descriptor when ANE detection comes back NO on this VM and SIGABRTs on
//     the first viewfinder render.
//
//  2. **AVCaptureDevice authorization gate** — `+[AVCaptureDevice
//     authorizationStatusForMediaType:]` in `AVFCapture` becomes
//     `mov w0, #3; ret`, `AVAuthorizationStatusAuthorized`. Every media type,
//     not just video: the VM does not service audio capture either, so an app
//     probing audio auth would have failed downstream regardless. Stage 0 of
//     the vcam stack — apps stop bailing on the auth check; frame delivery is
//     still owed by the downstream pipeline.
//
// What this port does not inherit
// -------------------------------
//
//   * **`ipsw dyld symaddr`.** The Python shells out to the Go tool and parses
//     its coloured output. Here the six symbols come from `DyldSharedCacheSymbolResolver`,
//     which reads the cache's own `.symbols` table. `DyldSharedCacheSymbolResolverTests`
//     pins all six against `ipsw` on the real cache, so the addresses are the
//     same addresses.
//   * **The raw-byte prologue test.** The Python compares the first four bytes
//     against `7f 23 03 d5`. Here the first instruction is decoded and its
//     mnemonic checked, per the patcher guardrails — an encoding of `pacibsp`
//     is recognised as `pacibsp`, not as four bytes.
//   * **Re-attesting per family.** The Python re-attests after each family, off
//     a list of bare addresses. Here every write is recorded by `DyldSharedCacheChunkSet`
//     and `reattestRecordedWrites` runs once at the end, off spans. Same pages
//     on this cache — the six sites are 8 bytes each and none is within 8 bytes
//     of a 16 KiB boundary — but a site that did straddle one would be fully
//     covered here and half-covered there.
//
// It does inherit the idempotence lesson the DSC gates taught three times
// (`cfw_patch_lsd_embedded_reg`, `cfw_patch_xpc_lwcr`,
// `cfw_patch_lockdown_mode` all raised on their own output). A prologue that is
// already the replacement is recognised as such and rewritten inertly, so a
// second install re-attests rather than throwing.
//
// Command contract preserved from the Python
// --------------------------------------
//
//     cfw.py patch-camera-dsc <chunks_dir> <dsc_header> [--dry-run] [--force]
//     cfw_patch_camera_dsc.py <chunks_dir> <dsc_header> [--dry-run] [--force]
//                             [--avf-only]
//
// `patch_camera_userland.sh dsc <chunks_dir> <dsc_header>` is the shape
// `cfw_install_exp.sh` calls, and it passes neither flag. `<chunks_dir>` is the
// directory of `dyld_shared_cache_arm64e*` files; `<dsc_header>` is the
// unsuffixed chunk inside it, which the Python needed only because `ipsw` wants
// a file rather than a directory. `applyAll` therefore takes the directory
// alone and finds the header itself; `symbolCacheURL` still lets a caller name
// the header separately, which is the only part of the two-argument shape a Command
// wrapper has to keep accepting.
//
// `--avf-only` is `applyAVFAuthorizationOnly`: the composition mode for a chunk
// pulled off a device that already carries the NeutrinoCore patches.
