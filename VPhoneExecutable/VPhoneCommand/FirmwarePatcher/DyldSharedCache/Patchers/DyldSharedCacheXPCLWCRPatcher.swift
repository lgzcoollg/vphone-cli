// DyldSharedCacheXPCLWCRPatcher.swift — libxpc's Lightweight Code Requirement self-check.
//
// Swift port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_xpc_lwcr.py` (`cfw.py
// patch-xpc-lwcr`). See Research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md #15.
//
// What breaks
// -----------
// iOS 27 introduced XPC "lightweight code requirements": a server pins a code
// requirement on its listener — `xpc_connection_set_peer_lightweight_code_
// requirement`, or the Swift `XPCPeerRequirement.hasEntitlement(_:)` wrapper —
// and libxpc evaluates whether a token satisfies it in
// `_xpc_token_satisfies_lwcr`. That function calls an internal matcher which
// returns two things — a `matched` bool in w0 and a `match_result.error_code`
// in memory — and then hard-asserts that the two agree:
//
//     bl      <matcher>            ; w0 = matched
//     ldr     wC, [xR]             ; wC = match_result.error_code
//     cmp     wC, #0               ; AICMR_MATCH == 0
//     cset    wC, ne               ; wC = (error_code != 0)
//     eor     wE, w0, wC           ; wE = matched ^ (error_code != 0)
//     tbz     wE, #0, <abort>      ; _os_crash_msg → brk #1 when they disagree
//
// On stock iOS the two always agree. Under the JB's code-signing environment
// the matcher's query writes `error_code = MATCH(0)` and then returns a failure
// status, producing the forbidden `(matched = 0, error_code = 0)` pair. libxpc
// aborts, so every daemon that pins an entitlement peer-requirement at startup
// — intelligencetasksd, searchpartyd, transparencyd, bluetoothd — crash-loops
// from boot.
//
// The fix
// -------
// Make `matched` consistent with `error_code` by construction and drop the
// abort. The return is derived from `error_code`, which is the matcher's own
// verdict, and the xor plus the conditional branch become NOPs:
//
//     cset  wC, ne   ->  cset w0, eq    ; w0 = matched = (error_code == 0)
//     eor   wE,…     ->  nop
//     tbz   wE,#0,…  ->  nop            ; falls through to the normal return
//
// Real allow/deny survives: `error_code` drives it exactly as stock does when
// the two agree, and only the internally contradictory case is resolved — in
// favour of "satisfied", because that is what `error_code` said.
//
// Nothing here is hardcoded. `_xpc_token_satisfies_lwcr` comes out of the
// cache's own local-symbol table, the function is disassembled with Capstone,
// the check is located by the shape of its control flow, and every replacement
// word comes from `ARM64Encoder` / `ARM64`. The pages the writes dirty are
// re-attested through `DyldSharedCacheCodeSignature`, because TXM validates the shared
// cache per 16 KiB page; the resulting cdHash change is accepted by the JB's
// always-true AMFI cdhash-trust patch.
