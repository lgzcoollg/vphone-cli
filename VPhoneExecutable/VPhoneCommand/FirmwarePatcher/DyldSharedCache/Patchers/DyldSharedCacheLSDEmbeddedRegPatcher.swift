// DyldSharedCacheLSDEmbeddedRegPatcher.swift — open lsd's embedded-registration gate.
//
// Swift port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_lsd_embedded_reg.py`, driven by
// `cfw.py patch-lsd-embedded-reg <chunks_dir> [--dry-run]`.
//
// iOS 27's lsd gates `-[_LSDModifyClient performPostInstallationRegistration:…]`
// — and its containerized/rebuild siblings — behind
// `-[_LSDModifyClient clientIsEntitledForEmbeddedRegistrationOperations]`, which
// calls `xpc_connection_copy_entitlement_value` on the XPC *peer* for any of
// three privileged entitlements (`com.apple.private.coreservices.lsaw`,
// `com.apple.private.installcoordinationd.daemon`,
// `com.apple.private.coreservices.can-register-install-results`). A client
// without one gets `NSOSStatusErrorDomain -54` (permErr) out of
// `LSDModifyService.mm`, so `registerApplicationDictionary:` returns NO. That
// blocks JB app registration (uicache/Sileo), vphoned's IPA installer and
// TrollStore alike.
//
// The entitlement route is a dead end on this stack: even a launchd-spawned
// platform daemon (vphoned) carrying all three in its *validated* csblob
// (`csops CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB` confirms) is still refused, because LS
// registration is proxied — the XPC peer lsd inspects is not the registering
// process.
//
// So the check is forced to succeed. The method ORs three entitlement probes:
//
//     bl  <check ent1> ; cbnz w0, entitled
//     bl  <check ent2> ; cbnz w0, entitled
//     bl  <check ent3> ; cbz  w0, not_entitled   <- the gate; this is NOP'd
//   entitled:
//     mov w20, #1                                 <- the YES result
//     … ; mov x0, x20 ; retab
//   not_entitled:
//     mov w20, #0
//
// NOP'ing that final `cbz w0, <not_entitled>` — the conditional branch whose
// fall-through is the `mov w<reg>, #1` that becomes the return value — makes
// every path reach YES. One instruction, one site.
//
// Nothing is hardcoded. The method is resolved from the cache's own
// `.symbols` local-symbol table, disassembled with Capstone, and the gate is
// found by control-flow shape rather than by address. The replacement is
// `ARM64.nop`. Writing a cache page invalidates its 16 KiB code slot, so the
// page is re-attested (TXM enforces per-page); the CDHash change that follows
// is accepted by the JB's always-true AMFI cdhash-trust patch.
