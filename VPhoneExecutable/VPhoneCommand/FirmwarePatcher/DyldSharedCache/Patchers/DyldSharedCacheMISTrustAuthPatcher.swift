// DyldSharedCacheMISTrustAuthPatcher.swift — force MIS's trust/authorization
// check to succeed.
//
// A guest restored by this project is *hacktivated*: `mobileactivationd`'s
// `-[DeviceType should_hactivate]` is forced to YES (see the
// `system-mobileactivationd-boot-should_hactivate` declaration), so the device never talks
// to Apple's activation service and never receives an activation record. That
// is what makes the VM boot without an Apple ID, and it is also why a profile
// that wants online authorization can never get it:
//
//     online-auth-agent: Failed to copy activation record.     (MobileActivation -1)
//     online-auth-agent: Couldn't get device identity          (MobileActivation -25)
//     online-auth-agent: Could not perform authorization attempt
//
// Without a device identity there is nothing to sign an authorization request
// with, so `libmis`'s `checkTrustAndAuthorization` returns
// `0xE8008026` — "missing trust and/or authorization" — and every consumer
// treats the profile as unvalidated:
//
//     SpringBoard: validation failed because of missing trust and/or authorization (0xe8008026)
//     SpringBoard: [<bundle id> - signature state: Profile Needs Network Validation,
//                  reason: Requires Network Validation
//
// The practical effect is that an app signed with a *free* personal-team
// Apple Development certificate installs but refuses to launch, and Settings'
// "Verify App" can never clear it. A paid team's profile is not marked as
// needing online authorization and is unaffected either way.
//
// ## What is patched
//
// `checkTrustAndAuthorization` is a static function — it carries no symbol, and
// the cache's local symbol table cannot name it. It does, however, name itself
// in its own log strings, one of which spells the function outright:
//
//     "cdHash (%p) or matchedProfileIDs (%p) NULL in checkTrustAndAuthorization"
//
// Its prologue seeds the return register with the failure code and the body
// then subtracts its way to the other MIS errors in that range, or replaces it
// with 0 on success:
//
//     pacibsp                            <- function start
//     sub  sp, sp, #0xa0
//     stp  x28, x27, [sp, #0x40]
//     …
//     mov  w21, #0x8026                  <- the default: 0xE8008026
//     movk w21, #0xe800, lsl #16
//     …
//     sub  w21, w21, #0x2                <- 0xE8008024, and so on
//     …
//     mov  x0, x21 ; retab               <- w21 is the return value
//
// Both callers inside `MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfoWithProgress` treat 0 as
// success, and the optional out-parameter is safe to leave untouched: one
// caller passes NULL for it outright, the other pre-zeroes the slot and skips
// the merge when it is still NULL. So the whole function is short-circuited:
//
//     pacibsp                            <- kept
//     mov  x0, #0                        <- was `sub sp, sp, #0xa0`
//     retab                              <- was `stp x28, x27, [sp, #0x40]`
//
// `pacibsp` is deliberately kept rather than overwritten. It signs LR with SP
// as the modifier, and `retab` authenticates with the SP it sees; returning
// before the frame is built means SP is unchanged between the two, so the pair
// is balanced. Replacing `pacibsp` with a plain `ret` would work here too, but
// keeping the PAC discipline intact is the smaller claim.
//
// ## Anchoring
//
// Nothing is hardcoded. Two independent routes must agree, in the manner of
// ``CustomFirmwareMobileActivation``:
//
//   1. The cstring above is located in the cache, its containing image is
//      confirmed to be `libmis.dylib`, and the ADRP+ADD pair that materialises
//      the literal is found by Capstone decode. Walking back from that site to
//      the nearest `pacibsp` gives the function start.
//   2. That prologue is then required to seed `0xE8008026` into the register
//      the function returns, within a short window — *or* to already hold this
//      patch's own output, `pacibsp ; mov x0, #0 ; retab`.
//
// If the string is gone the patch reports itself absent; if the string is there
// but the prologue is neither of those two shapes, MIS has changed and the
// install stops rather than guessing.
//
// The second shape is not decoration. The seed is normally several instructions
// into the prologue and survives the write, so the byte comparison in `patch`
// sees its own output and reports ``Outcome/alreadyPatched``. But where the
// compiler puts the seed in the two words this patch overwrites — reported on a
// 27.0 guest, `checkTrustAndAuthorization @ 0x22406F814` — the first run
// destroys the very anchor the second run looks for, and `cfw install` then
// dies part-way through on every later run. `DyldSharedCacheXPCLWCRPatcher` and
// `DyldSharedCacheLockdownModePatcher` were fixed for the same thing on
// 2026-09-22; this recognises its own shape the way they do.
//
// Writing a cache page invalidates its 16 KiB code slot, so the page is
// re-attested afterwards, exactly as the other shared-cache patchers do.
