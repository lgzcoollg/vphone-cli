// DyldSharedCacheMaxSlidePatcher.swift — Clamp the dyld shared cache's recorded maxSlide so
// a large userland cache fits the PCC vphone600 26.x kernel's fixed 6 GiB
// shared region.
//
// Swift port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_dsc_maxslide.py`, driven by
// `cfw.py patch-dsc-maxslide <chunks_dir> [--dry-run] [--force]` from
// `cfw_install.sh` and `cfw-kit/lib/base_stages.sh`.
//
// Why the patch exists
// --------------------
// The vphone600 26.x kernel reserves SHARED_REGION_SIZE_ARM64 = 0x180000000
// (6 GiB) at SHARED_REGION_BASE_ARM64 = 0x180000000 (verified by disassembling
// the arm64 case of the kernel's `shared_region_create`). At map time the kernel
// needs room for the cache's mapped span PLUS the cache header's `maxSlide` —
// the ASLR range it will pick a slide from. A newer userland whose cache nearly
// fills the region overflows it:
//
//     iOS 27.0 (24A5380h): span 0x17C830000 (~5.95 GiB)
//                        + maxSlide 0x20000000 (512 MiB)
//                        = 0x19C830000 (~6.46 GiB) > 0x180000000 (6 GiB)
//
// `_shared_region_map_and_slide` then returns ENOMEM, dyld cannot map
// libSystem, and launchd (pid 1) panics: "initproc failed to start -- Library
// not loaded: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib". Older userlands (26.x / 18.x) fit
// with their full slide and are unaffected.
//
// The fix is to zero `maxSlide`, so the cache maps at slide 0 and fits — iOS
// 27.0 leaves ~58 MiB spare. ASLR of the shared cache is lost; nothing else is.
//
// This patcher does NOT re-attest, and that is deliberate
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Every other DSC patcher in this module rewrites an instruction inside a
// dylib's `__TEXT` and has to repair the 16 KiB page slot that covers it, or
// the guest takes a KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE on the first demand-page-in.
//
// `maxSlide` is not that. It is a field of `dyld_cache_header`, read by the
// kernel while it is setting the mapping up — not a `cs_validate`'d code page.
// The Python reference states the same thing and backs it with a live test: a
// cache poked to maxSlide=0 booted with "dyld cache mapped system-wide" and 0
// panics, and `Research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md` row 10 records the
// on-device validation on `17,3_27.0_24A5380h` + cloudOS 26.4.
//
// So `DyldSharedCacheCodeSignature.reattestRecordedWrites(in:)` is *not* called here, and
// after this patcher runs the main chunk's page 0 hashes to something its code
// slot no longer claims. `DyldSharedCacheMaxSlidePatcherTests` pins that state rather than
// leaving it as a thing someone has to remember.
//
// To keep a later batch re-attestation from silently undoing that decision,
// this patcher opens its own `DyldSharedCacheChunkSet` over the directory instead of
// borrowing the caller's. Its write is recorded in a chunk set that goes out of
// scope with the call, so no caller's `reattestRecordedWrites(in:)` can sweep
// the header page up with the code pages it legitimately owns.
//
// On the CLAUDE.md patcher guardrails
// -----------------------------------
// There is no instruction here to decode and none to assemble: the patch writes
// a little-endian u64 metadata field, so Capstone and the Keystone-backed
// `ARM64Encoder` have nothing to contribute. What replaces them is the
// structural check in `readHeader`: the field offsets come from
// `dyld_cache_header` in dyld's `dyld_cache_format.h`, and before they are
// trusted this code applies dyld's own version gate (`mappingOffset` must reach
// past the field) and cross-checks the values it reads against the mapping
// table it parsed independently. A cache whose header does not corroborate the
// layout is refused rather than written into blind.
