// DyldSharedCacheLockdownModePatcher.swift — Stop libSystem's `os_lockdown_mode_enabled`
// from crashing on the vphone kernel.
//
// iOS 27's `os_lockdown_mode_enabled()` resolves Lockdown Mode once, from a
// block, via `sysctlbyname("security.mac.lockdown_mode_state_public", …)` and
// `os_crash`es when the sysctl returns -1 (`lockdown_mode.c`). The vphone base
// kernel (cloudOS 26.x) does not implement that MAC sysctl, so the call fails
// with ENOENT and every process that queries Lockdown Mode aborts — including
// launchd (pid 1), which panics the system right after "Continuing system
// boot".
//
// The block pre-zeroes its output buffer (`stp x8, xzr, [sp]`), so dropping the
// error branch makes the failure path fall through to the normal path, read 0,
// and record "Lockdown Mode disabled". On a kernel that does implement the
// sysctl the branch is never taken, so the patch is behaviour-neutral there.
//
// Shape (in `___os_lockdown_mode_enabled_block_invoke`):
//
//     bl      <sysctlbyname>
//     cmn     w0, #1            ; w0 == -1 ?
//     b.eq    <os_crash>        ; -> NOP
//
// Anchored on the in-image local symbol; the sysctl-error idiom is located by
// control-flow shape through Capstone; the NOP comes from `ARM64.nop`; the
// modified page is re-attested through `DyldSharedCacheCodeSignature`.
//
// Port of `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_lockdown_mode.py`, which stays the
// independent reference — `DyldSharedCacheLockdownModePatcherTests` runs the Python on one
// clone of the real cache and this on another, and compares the two byte for
// byte.
//
// One cosmetic divergence, in text only: this links Capstone 6 and the
// reference runs Capstone 5, which prints a branch target as `0x237ef22bc`
// where the older one prints `#0x237ef22bc`. That string reaches the log line
// and the `PatchRecord` description, never a patched byte, and nothing here
// matches on operand text.
