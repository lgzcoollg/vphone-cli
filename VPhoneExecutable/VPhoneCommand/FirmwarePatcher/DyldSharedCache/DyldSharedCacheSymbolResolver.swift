// DyldSharedCacheSymbolResolver.swift — Symbol addresses in the shared cache, without `ipsw`.
//
// Three CFW patchers used to shell out to `ipsw dyld symaddr`:
// `cfw_patch_camera_dsc.py`, `cfw_patch_iomfb_swapend.py` and
// `cfw_patch_iomfb_force_kern.py`. Between them they need two kinds of symbol,
// and the cache stores them in two different places:
//
//   * **Exported** symbols — `_IOMobileFramebufferSwapBegin` and its siblings —
//     live in each image's export trie, addressed as an offset from the image's
//     mach header.
//   * **Local** symbols — every `+[Class method]`, and private C functions such
//     as `_kern_SwapEnd` — are stripped out of the images at cache-build time
//     and parked in `dyld_shared_cache_<arch>.symbols`, sliced per image.
//
// Resolving both, per image, is what replaces the Go tool on the patch path.
