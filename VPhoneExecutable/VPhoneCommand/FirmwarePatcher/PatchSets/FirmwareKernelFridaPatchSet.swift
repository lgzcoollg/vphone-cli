// FirmwareKernelFridaPatchSet.swift — Manifest for the Frida Stalker relaxations.
//
// Two kernel checks stand between Frida's Stalker and a working trace: the
// entitlement flag thread_set_state wants, and the immutability vm_map_delete
// enforces over code pages. Neither is needed to boot, and both widen what any
// process in the guest can do, so this set is opt-in — no preset that a VM gets
// by default includes it.
//
// Gated to cloudOS 26.4 and newer, where these shapes were verified.
