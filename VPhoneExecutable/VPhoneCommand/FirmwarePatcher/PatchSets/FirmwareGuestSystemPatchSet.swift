// What `cfw install` does after the restore: the shared-cache policy gates a 27
// userland needs, the handful of system daemons that must be patched to start on
// a research board, and the vphone payload itself.
//
// Unlike the boot chain, several of these are Mach-O or shared-cache edits that
// emit no patch record — a string mangled in place, a file installed. Their
// identifiers name the operation instead of mirroring a record, and they are
// still the names a preset selects and the UI lists.
