// VPhonePatchGate.swift — What a patcher asks before it writes.
//
// A gate is the plan reduced to the one question a patch site has: do I apply?
// It is a value, not a reference, so a patcher can hold one without owning the
// plan, and it defaults to ``unrestricted`` — a patcher built directly, as the
// tests build them, behaves exactly as it did before gates existed.
//
// Gates answer about *record* identifiers, because that is what a patch site has
// in hand, and record identifiers are finer than declarations: one declaration
// covers `jb.kcall10.sy_call` and its three siblings. A record no declaration
// covers is a gap in a manifest, not a patch the user turned off, so the gate
// applies it and says so. Failing open keeps a missed declaration from silently
// changing the firmware; the warning is what makes the gap findable.
