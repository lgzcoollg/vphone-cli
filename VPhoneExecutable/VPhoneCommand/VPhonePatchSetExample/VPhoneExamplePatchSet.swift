// VPhoneExamplePatchSet.swift — The template a `.vphonepatchset` is copied from.
//
// This builds `VPhonePatchSetExample.vphonepatchset`. It is not staged into
// VPhone.bundle and no shipped preset names it: it exists so the loader has
// something real to load in the tests, and so an author has a working set to copy
// rather than a description of one.
//
// Three pieces, and that is the whole contract:
//
//   1. `Contents/Resources/Manifest.plist` — what the set declares. Read before any
//      of this code is mapped.
//   2. A ``VPhonePatchSetPrincipal`` subclass, handed to the loader by the one
//      exported symbol `vphone_patch_set_principal`.
//   3. A ``BufferedPatcher`` per component the manifest declares a patch for.
//      Anything else the pipeline cannot read bytes back from.
//
// What the example patch does: rewrite one ASCII string in iBEC, in place, to a
// replacement of the same length or shorter. A string rewrite is the simplest whole
// class of firmware patch — it is how the serial labels in the bundled boot-chain
// set work — and it needs no instruction encoding, so the shape stays visible.
//
// Both strings come from the preset's `Parameters`, so the set patches nothing
// until a preset says what to rewrite. To make this a real patch instead of a
// template, delete the parameter lookup, hardcode your anchor, and follow it to the
// site you actually want: `ARM64Disassembler` decodes, `ARM64Encoder` and the
// `ARM64` constants produce replacement instructions, and `BinaryBuffer` holds the
// bytes. Never write an instruction word as a literal — see the kernel patcher
// guardrails in AGENTS.md.
