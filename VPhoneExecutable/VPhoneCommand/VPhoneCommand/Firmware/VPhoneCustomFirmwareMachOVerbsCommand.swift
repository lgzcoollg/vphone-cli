// VPhoneCustomFirmwareMachOVerbsCommand.swift — `cfw` verbs for the standalone Mach-O patchers.
//
// Six faces over `FirmwarePatcher/CustomFirmware/ExecutablePatches/`, replacing
// `"$PYTHON3" scripts/patchers/cfw.py <verb> <binary>` in `cfw_install*.sh`,
// `cfw-kit/` and `scripts/patch_hv_vmm_userland.sh`. The verb names, their
// positional arguments and their flags are exactly the Python's — `cfw.py`
// gives only `patch-watchdogd` a `--dry-run`, so only that one has one here.
//
// RE-ATTESTATION. Each library type decides for itself whether to recompute the
// CodeDirectory slot hash of the page it dirties, and the settings below are
// chosen so the bytes these verbs write equal the bytes the Python writes:
//
//   * seputil and mobileactivationd re-attest by default, which the Python does
//     not do — `reattest: false` / `resign: false` restores parity.
//   * launchd_cache_loader, launchd (jetsam) and diskimagesiod default to off,
//     matching their Python. Passed explicitly anyway, so the choice is visible
//     at the call site rather than inherited from a default that could move.
//   * watchdogd has no switch, and needs none: `cfw_patch_watchdogd.py` calls
//     `cfw_macho_codesign.reattest_modified_offsets` itself, so both sides
//     re-attest and both write the same file.
//
// Nothing is lost by turning it off: every shipped caller runs `ldid_sign` over
// the binary on the next line, which rebuilds the signature whole.
//
// STDOUT. Each library type already prints its own progress, so — as with
// `patch-build-version` and friends in VPhoneCustomFirmwarePatchCommand.swift — these commands
// print nothing of their own. The Python writes every line to stdout, so the
// log closure is `print` even for the two types whose default is stderr.
//
// IDEMPOTENCE. The Swift recognises its own output and reports "already
// patched" without writing; several of the Pythons do not (seputil's anchor
// string is gone after the first run, the cache-loader gate is no longer a
// conditional branch) and exit 1 on a second run. That difference is
// deliberate and documented in each library type's header — a re-run over an
// already-installed volume is a normal thing for `cfw install` to do.
