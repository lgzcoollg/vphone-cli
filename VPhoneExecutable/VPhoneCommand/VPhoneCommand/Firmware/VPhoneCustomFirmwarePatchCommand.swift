// VPhoneCustomFirmwarePatchCommand.swift — the `cfw` subcommands that replace the Python patchers.
//
// Each one is a thin face over a type in `FirmwarePatcher/CustomFirmware/`. The Python they
// replace (`scripts/patchers/cfw.py` and friends) was removed once the
// installers switched to these verbs — `git show 78cbeea:scripts/patchers` to
// read it. The bar every command here had to clear is that its stdout is the
// Python's stdout — `cfw_install.sh:207-208` reads
// `cryptex-paths` with `head -1`/`tail -1`, and a human reads the rest out of an
// install log. Where the library already prints (build-version, campo,
// post-restore-dt), the command passes `verbose: true` and prints nothing of its
// own rather than inventing a second voice.
