// These are the shapes `ipsw` was called in from the CFW installers and from
// fw_prepare.sh, and they are the last of them. `ipsw` is a fine program —
// statically linked Go, nothing but system libraries — but it is a program the
// user has to install with Homebrew before a .app that is supposed to be
// self-contained can finish a job, which is the thing `Build/ValidateBundle.sh` exists
// to stop.

//     ipsw fw aea --key <f>                       ->  vphone-cli fw aea-key <f>
//     ipsw img4 im4p create --type T --version V  ->  vphone-cli fw im4p-create
//     ipsw img4 im4p extract --output O <f>       ->  vphone-cli fw im4p-extract
