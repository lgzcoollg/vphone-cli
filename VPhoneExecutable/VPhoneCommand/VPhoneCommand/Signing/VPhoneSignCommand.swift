// VPhoneSignCommand.swift — `sign` and `dump-entitlements`, which replace ldid.
//
// ldid is the one program this project shipped that links Homebrew
// (libcrypto.3, libplist-2.0.4), and so the one thing that failed the
// self-contained admission rule. `VPhoneSign` writes the same bytes out of the
// system frameworks; these two commands are the shape the installers called the
// tool in:
//
//     ldid -S"$ent" -M "-K$p12" -I"$id" <file>   ->  vphone-cli sign …
//     ldid -e <file>                             ->  vphone-cli dump-entitlements
//
// There is no way back to the external tool. `--use-ldid` and the VPHONE_USE_LDID
// environment variable behind it are gone: an escape hatch that shells out to a
// Homebrew binary is a dependency whether or not the default path takes it, and
// this project is meant to be self-contained. What guarded the replacement stays
// where it belongs — Tests/VPhoneSignTests holds these bytes against digests
// taken from the real ldid and frozen into the suite, over committed fixtures.
// It needs no ldid installed and no system binary to sign, so it cannot skip
// itself into passing on a machine that has neither.

        Writes, by default, byte for byte what ldid writes: no CMS blob, no
        ad-hoc flag, and the designated requirement ldid synthesises. That is
        what the guest's AMFI is known to accept, and what every call site in
        this repository has always produced. `codesign --verify` rejects it —
        it rejects ldid's own output too, for the same two reasons. Pass
        --apple-adhoc for a signature in Apple's shape instead, which is what
        `codesign --sign -` writes and what codesign will verify.

        The file is replaced by rename(2) over a temporary beside it, with the
        original mode copied across. That is deliberate: most of what this signs
        came out of an IPSW at mode 444, and renaming over such a file needs
        write permission on the directory, not on the file. An interrupted run
        leaves the original untouched rather than half written.

        --merge is ldid's -M: the entitlements given are merged over whatever
        the file already carries, rather than replacing them. Without it, a
        re-sign silently drops the sandbox profile and private entitlements a
        binary like diskimagesiod cannot run without.
