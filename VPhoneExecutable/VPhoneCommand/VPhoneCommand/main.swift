// This binary carries no entitlements at all, which is the whole point: it
// launches normally on any host, so it is always available to explain what is
// wrong and to arrange whatever the actual work needs. The private
// virtualization entitlements live on `vphone-vm`, which this starts as a
// child when a boot is asked for.
//
// Booting used to happen right here — the process parsed `boot` and then
// became the NSApplication itself, which is why the top-level binary had to
// carry the entitlements and could not start without an AMFI bypass already
// running.
