// CustomFirmwareMachOTests.swift — Mach-O load-command insertion and code-signature re-attestation.
//
// The modules are checked against independent effects:
//
//   * `CustomFirmwareInjectDylib` loads a real Objective-C swizzle dylib into
//     a small executable, changing its observed output.
//   * `CustomFirmwareMachOCodeSignature` against `scripts/patchers/cfw_macho_codesign.py`,
//     byte for byte. That Python is gone, so what it wrote is frozen in
//     ``MachOCodeSignGolden`` below — over the real 24A435 `seputil` rather
//     than a local build product, because a golden is only worth what its
//     input is reproducible.
//
// Everything that can be asserted without a reference is asserted, first
// among them the short tail slot, which is the known regression in independent
// re-signing.
//
// Every test that needs a signed Mach-O now operates on that same `seputil`.
// It used to be `.build/release/vphone-letmein` — a convenient small binary
// that has since been removed from the project — and the shapes those tests
// want are properties of the *input*, not of anything a local link guarantees:
// a SHA-256 code directory, a codeLimit that is not page aligned, and enough
// zero padding behind the load commands to insert a command into. A frozen
// fixture has them on purpose; a build product had them by luck.
//
// The fixture is therefore required, the way the sibling CFW parity suites
// require it: point `VPHONE_MACHO_PRISTINE` at a directory of pristine Mach-Os
// or leave the default `ipsws/ref_extract/macho_pristine` in place. Without it
// these tests FAIL rather than skip, because a skipped test reads like a
// passing one. A machine that genuinely cannot carry the extracted IPSW sets
// `VPHONE_MACHO_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1`, which turns the failure back into a skip.
