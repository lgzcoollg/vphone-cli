// CustomFirmwareWatchDogTests.swift — parity, anchoring and idempotence for the
// watchdogd hv_vmm_present cache patch.
//
// Two independent references were available for this patch and both are used:
//
//   * `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_watchdogd.py`, driven exactly as
//     `cfw_install_exp.sh` drove it (`cfw.py patch-watchdogd <binary>`). That
//     Python is gone; what it wrote over the pristine binary is frozen in
//     ``WatchdogdGolden`` below, and the central test grades `CustomFirmwareWatchDog`
//     against it byte for byte — patched instructions and re-attested code
//     slots alike, because that verb re-attested on its own.
//   * `/usr/bin/codesign`, which recomputes the slot hashes itself. It has no
//     part in this code, so a binary that verifies under it is evidence the
//     re-attestation is right rather than self-consistent.
//
// The fixture is the real `/usr/libexec/watchdogd` from iOS 27.0 (24A435,
// iPhone17,3), at `ipsws/ref_extract/macho_pristine/watchdogd`. That tree is
// read-only reference data: every test here clones what it needs into the
// system temp directory and never writes inside it.
