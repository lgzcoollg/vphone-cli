// CustomFirmwareSeputilTests.swift — Parity cross-checks for `CustomFirmwareSeputil`.
//
// Two independent references, and every claim below is measured against one of
// them rather than against a number written down by hand:
//
//   * `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_seputil.py`, driven through the exact Command
//     `scripts/cfw_install.sh` called — `cfw.py patch-seputil <binary>`. That
//     Python is gone; what it produced on this fixture is frozen in
//     ``SeputilGolden`` below, digest by digest, so the comparison survives it.
//     The Swift patcher run with `reattest: false` must reproduce the digest of
//     the file the Python wrote, and run with re-attestation on it must
//     reproduce the digest of that same file put through the Python's own
//     re-attester (`cfw_macho_codesign.reattest_modified_offsets`). The second
//     digest is what proves the slot hashes agree: it covers the hashes where
//     they live, in the file, not values this module reported about itself.
//   * `/usr/bin/codesign -v`, which for a standalone Mach-O is a real second
//     opinion on whether the signature still covers the file. The test asserts
//     both directions — the re-attested binary verifies and the one that
//     matches the frozen Python digest does not — so a `codesign` that passed
//     everything would fail this suite instead of quietly blessing it.
//
// The fixture is the real 24A435 / iPhone17,3 `seputil`. Point
// `VPHONE_MACHO_PRISTINE` at a directory of pristine Mach-O binaries or leave
// the default `ipsws/ref_extract/macho_pristine` in place.
//
// Without it these FAIL, following `DyldSharedCacheFoundationTests`: a `guard … else
// { return }` is reported by Swift Testing as a pass, so a green run on a
// machine with no fixture would be indistinguishable from a green run that
// proved something. Set `VPHONE_MACHO_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1` to turn that failure
// into a visible skip.
//
// Nothing here writes anywhere under `ipsws/ref_extract/`: that tree is the
// pristine reference the whole suite compares against. Clones land in
// `ipsws/scratch_cfwseputil/`, on the same filesystem, so `cp -c` is a
// `clonefile(2)`.
