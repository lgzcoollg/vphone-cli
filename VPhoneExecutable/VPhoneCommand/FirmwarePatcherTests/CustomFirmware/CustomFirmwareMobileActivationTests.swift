// from the same input, on the real iOS 27.0 / 24A435 iPhone17,3
// `/usr/libexec/mobileactivationd` in `ipsws/ref_extract/macho_pristine/`, and
// that the result passes `codesign -v` — two references, neither of them this
// code. The Python is gone; what it wrote is frozen digest by digest in
// ``MobileactivationdGolden``, so the comparison outlived it. The comparisons
// are still gated on the pristine binary, which is not in the repo.
//
// Outputs are kept on disk, not in a scratch directory that vanishes, so the
// same comparison can be re-run by hand with `cmp`, `shasum` and `codesign`.
// They go wherever `VPHONE_TEST_ARTIFACTS` points, defaulting to a named
// directory under `TMPDIR` — never inside the repository, and never inside
// `ipsws/ref_extract/`, which is the read-only reference tree.
