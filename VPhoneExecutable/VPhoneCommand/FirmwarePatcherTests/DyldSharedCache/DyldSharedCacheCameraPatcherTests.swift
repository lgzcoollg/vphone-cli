// DyldSharedCacheCameraPatcherTests.swift — Parity gate for the camera DSC patcher.
//
// The claim these tests exist to defend is narrow and checkable: running
// `DyldSharedCacheCameraPatcher` over a clone of the real shared cache leaves exactly the
// bytes `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_camera_dsc.py` left — patched instructions,
// rewritten code slots and everything neither touched.
//
// That Python has been removed, so the numbers it produced are frozen in
// `FrozenReference` below: the six sites with the address, the prologue and the
// replacement for each, the code slots it re-attested, the SHA-256 of the two
// chunks it changed, the patch ids its `_sym_slug` derived, and the bytes
// keystone assembled for both replacements. Each carries the run that produced
// it.
//
// The tests need the real cache. `VPHONE_DSC_PRISTINE` points at a directory of
// `dyld_shared_cache_arm64e*` chunks, defaulting to
// `ipsws/ref_extract/dsc_pristine`.
//
// Without it they FAIL. A bare `return` in place of a fixture is reported by
// Swift Testing as a pass, so "the camera port is green" would be equally
// compatible with "the camera port was never run". A machine that genuinely
// cannot carry the 6.7 GB fixture sets `VPHONE_DSC_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1`, which
// turns the failure into a visible *skip*.
//
// Nothing here writes into the pristine directory, or anywhere else in the
// working tree. Clones go to the system temp directory — `clonefile`, so
// instant and near-free on APFS — and are discarded afterwards.
// `VPHONE_DSC_SCRATCH` moves them somewhere else on the same volume.
