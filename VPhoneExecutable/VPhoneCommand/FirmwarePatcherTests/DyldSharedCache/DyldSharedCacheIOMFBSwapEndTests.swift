// DyldSharedCacheIOMFBSwapEndTests.swift — Parity for the IOMFB SwapEnd payload-size patch.
//
// There is no independent checker for a patched dyld shared cache: `codesign -v`
// does not apply to a cache chunk, and the only other implementation of this
// patch was `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_iomfb_swapend.py`, driven through
// `cfw.py patch-iomfb-swapend` exactly as `cfw_install*.sh` and `cfw-kit`
// invoked it. That Python has been removed, so what it produced on the real
// 24A435 arm64e cache — at each of the three target sizes — is frozen in
// `FrozenReference` below: the site it landed on, the size it found there, and
// the SHA-256 of the one chunk it changed. `DyldSharedCacheIOMFBSwapEndPatcher` runs on a
// clone and is graded against those. A patch that lands in the right place but
// re-attests a different page lands on a different digest.
//
// The cache is required. `VPHONE_DSC_PRISTINE` points at it, defaulting to
// `ipsws/ref_extract/dsc_pristine`, and its absence FAILS rather than passing
// quietly: a `guard let … else { return }` is reported by Swift Testing as a
// pass, so "the tests are green" would be equally compatible with "the tests did
// nothing". A machine that genuinely cannot carry the 6.7 GB fixture sets
// `VPHONE_DSC_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1` and gets a visible *skip* instead.
//
// Nothing here writes into the pristine directory. Clones are made with
// `clonefile` (`cp -c`) into `ipsws/scratch_dsciomfbswapend`, which is on the
// same filesystem, so a clone is instant and costs only the pages that change.
// Override the location with `VPHONE_DSC_SCRATCH`.
//
// The shape tests below need none of that: they assemble the call set-up with
// `ARM64Encoder` — the same instructions `cfw_patch_iomfb_swapend._self_test()`
// builds with keystone — and run the finder over it, so the anchor's semantics
// are pinned on every machine, fixture or no fixture.
