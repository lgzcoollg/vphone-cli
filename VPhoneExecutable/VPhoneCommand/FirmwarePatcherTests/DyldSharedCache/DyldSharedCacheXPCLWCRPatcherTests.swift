// DyldSharedCacheXPCLWCRPatcherTests.swift — Parity for the libxpc LWCR patch.
//
// The only independent reference for this patch was
// `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_xpc_lwcr.py`, driven through `cfw.py
// patch-xpc-lwcr`. That Python is gone, so what it produced on the real cache
// is frozen in `FrozenReference` below — the three sites, the six instruction
// words, and the SHA-256 of the one chunk it changed. `DyldSharedCacheXPCLWCRPatcher` runs
// on a clone and is graded against those. A port that writes the right
// instruction at the wrong address, or re-attests a different page, lands on a
// different digest.
//
// Fixture: `VPHONE_DSC_PRISTINE`, or `ipsws/ref_extract/dsc_pristine` by
// default. Without it these FAIL. A bare `guard let … else { return }` is
// reported by Swift Testing as a pass, so "all green" on a machine that never
// extracted the 6.7 GB cache would mean nothing. A machine that genuinely
// cannot carry the fixture sets `VPHONE_DSC_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1` and gets a
// visible *skip* instead.
//
// Nothing here writes to the pristine directory. Clones are made with
// `cp -c` — APFS `clonefile`, so instant and near-free — under the system
// temporary directory, or `VPHONE_DSC_SCRATCH` when it is set.
