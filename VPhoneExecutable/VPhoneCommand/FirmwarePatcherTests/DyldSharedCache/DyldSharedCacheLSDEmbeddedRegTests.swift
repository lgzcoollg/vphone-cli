// DyldSharedCacheLSDEmbeddedRegTests.swift — parity for the lsd embedded-registration gate.
//
// The patch is one instruction in a 6.7 GB cache, and a wrong one is a boot
// panic rather than a failing assertion, so the reference these tests grade
// against is the Python that shipped before this port: `cfw.py
// patch-lsd-embedded-reg`. That Python has since been deleted, so its result
// is frozen here instead of re-run: `FrozenReference` below records the site
// it found, the bytes it wrote and the SHA-256 of every chunk it changed, and
// the Swift patcher is graded against those numbers. Each constant names the
// command that produced it.
//
// The cache is required. Point `VPHONE_DSC_PRISTINE` at a directory of
// `dyld_shared_cache_arm64e*` chunks, or leave the default
// `ipsws/ref_extract/dsc_pristine` in place. Without it these tests FAIL — the
// suite never opens with a bare `return`, which Swift Testing reports as a
// pass, so a green run cannot mean the cache was absent. A machine that
// genuinely cannot carry the fixture sets `VPHONE_DSC_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1`,
// which turns the failure into a visible skip.
//
// Nothing here writes to the pristine tree. Clones are made with `clonefile`
// (instant and near-free on APFS) under the system temporary directory, or
// under `VPHONE_DSC_SCRATCH` when the caller names one.
