// DyldSharedCacheLockdownModePatcherTests.swift — Parity for the lockdown-mode DSC patch.
//
// The only independent reference for this patch was
// `scripts/patchers/cfw_patch_lockdown_mode.py`, driven exactly as
// `cfw_install.sh` drove it: `cfw.py patch-lockdown-mode <chunks_dir>`. That
// Python has been removed, so what it produced on the real cache is frozen in
// `FrozenReference` below — the block and gate addresses, the instruction word
// on each side of the write, and the SHA-256 of the one chunk it changed. The
// central test clones the cache, runs `DyldSharedCacheLockdownModePatcher` on the clone and
// grades it against those, chunk bytes and re-attested code slot alike.
//
// The tests need the real cache. Point `VPHONE_DSC_PRISTINE` at a directory of
// `dyld_shared_cache_arm64e*` chunks, or leave the default
// `ipsws/ref_extract/dsc_pristine` in place.
//
// Without it they FAIL. They do not open with a bare `return` on a missing
// fixture: Swift Testing reports that as a pass, so "all tests passed" would be
// equally compatible with "no test touched a cache". A machine that genuinely
// cannot carry the 6.7 GB fixture sets `VPHONE_DSC_FIXTURE_OPTIONAL=1`, which
// turns the failure into a visible *skip*.
//
// Nothing here writes into the pristine directory, or anywhere else in the
// working tree. Clones are made with `clonefile` under the system temp
// directory — instant and near-free on APFS — and removed again.
