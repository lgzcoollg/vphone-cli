// VPhoneAEA.swift — the AEA1 prologue, and the key Apple hands back for it.
//
// This replaces `ipsw fw aea`, which was the last thing in the CFW install path
// that needed a Homebrew program on the machine running the install. Three
// shapes were used: `--info` (the archive's auth data), `--key` (the symmetric
// key) and `-o` (decrypt). The first two are here; the third is
// `/usr/bin/aea decrypt`, which ships with macOS.
//
// Two facts make this small. The prologue is a flat list of length-prefixed
// key/value records, so reading it needs no framework at all. And the key
// exchange is plain RFC 9180 HPKE — base mode, DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256),
// HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM, empty `info` and empty `aad` — which CryptoKit
// implements, so there is no crypto written here either.
//
// The one thing that is not local is the private key: `fcs-key-url` points at
// wkms-public.apple.com and the archive cannot be opened without fetching it.
// That is Apple's design, not a dependency this project added — `ipsw` made the
// same request.
