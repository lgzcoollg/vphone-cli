    // run, and failing all of those a scan of `PATH` for python3.14 down to
    // python3.10 and then `/usr/bin/python3`. The one program that needed it
    // was the pymobiledevice3 restore bridge, and the restore backend is now
    // libirecovery + idevicerestore linked into this binary (`VPhoneRestore`).
    //
    // The whole ladder is gone rather than left unused, because the last rung
    // was the dangerous one: a `PATH` fallback makes a missing environment look
    // like a working one, right up until a restore fails on a stranger's
    // machine. Nothing in this package may resolve an interpreter again — see
    // the "Python" section in AGENTS.md, and `Build/ValidateBundle.sh`, which now
    // fails outright on a python3 lookup instead of registering it.

    // With the interpreter went the last `PATH` lookup in this package. Every
    // program vphone-cli runs is either a sibling of the running image
    // (`siblingExecutable`) or a bundled script under `scriptsDir`.
