/// Compares two property lists for *semantic* equality.

/// Byte equality is the wrong bar for the plists in this migration, and not
/// merely a strict one — it is unreachable. `plistlib.dump` and
/// `PropertyListEncoder` disagree about `<data>` line width, `<real>`
/// formatting, indentation and escaping, so matching bytes would mean
/// reimplementing plistlib's writer to no purpose. Nothing downstream hashes
/// or signs these files; every consumer parses them.
///
/// What does matter, and what this checks:
///
/// - **Type identity.** `Int` and `String` are not interchangeable. A version
///   number that becomes `"26"` instead of `26` parses fine and then fails
///   somewhere far away.
/// - **Array order.** `BuildIdentities` and `SystemRestoreImageFileSystems`
///   are ordered; position carries meaning.
/// - **`Data` contents**, byte for byte.
/// - **Exact key sets.** Neither extra keys nor missing ones.
///
/// Note `plutil -p` does not do this job: it parses and pretty-prints, so it
/// is neither a byte comparison nor a typed one.
