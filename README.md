# vphone-cli

> Looking for vphone-cli 1.x? See the [1.0.14 release](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/releases/tag/1.0.14).

Create and run a virtual iPhone on an Apple Silicon Mac. vphone-cli uses Apple's Virtualization.framework and PCC research VM infrastructure.

Version 2.x applies the complete firmware patch set, including changes previously offered as EXP. There are no selectable patch variants. The self-contained `VPhone.bundle` handles firmware preparation, restore, and VM control; `vphone-launchpad` installs the bundle and guides you through creating and running a VM.

The recommended host setup runs `csrutil enable --without debug` and `csrutil allow-research-guests enable` in macOS Recovery. SIP remains enabled with debugging restrictions relaxed. Launchpad checks the host and uses its privileged helper to allow each verified VM binary through AMFI; see [host setup](Documents/Guides/host-setup.md) for details.

## Get started

Use the notarized [vphone-launchpad 2.0.8](https://github.com/Lakr233/vphone-cli/releases/download/2.0.8/vphone-launchpad-2.0.8-notarized.zip) on a physical Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 15 or newer. The release needs no Xcode, Python, or Homebrew at runtime.

1. In macOS Recovery, run `csrutil enable --without debug` and `csrutil allow-research-guests enable`, then restart. See [host setup](Documents/Guides/host-setup.md) for details.
2. Unzip and open the app. Complete **Host Setup**, including Developer Tools access and installation of the privileged helper.
3. In **Core Bundle**, choose **Download and Install** for the latest `VPhone.bundle`. Launchpad verifies the download and prepares its VM binary for the host.
4. In **Machines**, choose **New Machine**, select a firmware pairing from the catalog, and click **Create**. Launchpad completes the first-boot check and leaves the VM running.

Catalog pairings download firmware. Creating a VM needs network access for restore tickets and substantial free disk space, even with local IPSWs. You can supply your own compatible iPhone and cloudOS IPSWs. See [compatibility](Documents/Guides/compatibility.md) for verified pairs. For source builds and terminal workflows, see [host setup](Documents/Guides/host-setup.md) and [create and run](Documents/Guides/create-and-run.md).

Version 2.x starts only VMs created with its `schemaVersion=2` format. Older VMs must be recreated.

## Custom Firmware Bootstrap

After launching the VM, choose **Guest > Install Bootstrap…** from the macOS menu bar and select a layout. This installs Irisin in the guest.

For the first setup, select `apt` and `bash` in Irisin. Press and hold the **Install** button, then choose **Bootstrap Install**. This mode unpacks all packages in the installation before running the installation steps again. It resolves the initial dependency cycle where `debianutils` needs `bash`, but `bash` needs `debianutils` to have been configured. Use regular installation after this setup is complete.

## Everyday use

The VM window provides app and file browsing, clipboard and preference tools, screenshots, recording, and diagnostics. For local automation, launch with `--api-listen 127.0.0.1:8765`. The VM prints a new API token at each launch as `[api] token: …`, or uses `VPHONE_API_TOKEN` when you set it. Send the token with every request, for example `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/health`. Requests without the token are refused, and so are requests from web pages. See the [guest API](Research/vphoned_http_api.md).

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| List VMs | `vphone-cli vm list` |
| Inspect a VM | `vphone-cli vm info myphone` |
| Start the VM window | `vphone-cli vm launch myphone` |
| Stop a VM | `vphone-cli vm stop myphone` |
| Export a backup | `vphone-cli vm export myphone --out myphone.tzst` |
| Import a backup | `vphone-cli vm import myphone.tzst --name restored` |

VMs live under `~/.vphone/` by default. Run `vphone-cli <group> --help` for more commands.

## How it fits together

`vphone-cli` prepares firmware, restores VMs, and manages their lifecycle. The bundled `vphone-vm` runs the guest and owns its macOS window. Inside the guest, `vphoned` provides the controls used by the window and the optional HTTP and WebSocket API. The `VPhone` Xcode scheme builds and validates the self-contained `VPhone.bundle`.
