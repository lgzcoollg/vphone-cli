// MARK: - Profile UDID

/// The UDID libmisfix gives the hooked daemons when they check a provisioning
/// profile's `ProvisionedDevices` (`VPhoneGuestComponents/MISFix`). Lockdown,
/// Xcode and devicectl keep seeing the guest's own UDID; only the hooked
/// daemons see this one.
///
/// The hook reads the first of two files that exists and re-reads it when its
/// modification time or size changes. vphoned owns the data-volume file.
/// Clearing keeps that file with the key removed rather than deleting it:
/// the file then still comes first, so a UDID left in the `/usr/lib` copy
/// cannot take over again.
///
/// A change also stops every daemon that carries the hook, so the next check
/// runs in a fresh process that has cached nothing. launchd starts them on
/// demand.
///
/// That means installd as well as misagent, and it used to mean only misagent.
/// The reason given was that installd "asks misagent", and it does not: a
/// lockdown-path install runs
/// `+[MICodeSigningVerifier _validateSignatureAndCopyInfoForURL:withOptions:error:]`
/// inside installd, which calls `MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo` and evaluates
/// the profile's `ProvisionedDevices` itself. Two processes answer the UDID
/// question independently — which is why `cfw install` injects libmisfix into
/// both — so refreshing one and not the other leaves them disagreeing.
///
/// Measured on test-26.4 (2026-09-30): with the override changed to a UDID in
/// the profile and only misagent restarted, `_installEmbeddedProfilesWithError:`
/// passed and installd then failed the same install with `0xE8008015`, "A valid
/// provisioning profile for this executable was not found", because installd was
/// still holding the previous UDID from before the change.
///
/// Stopping installd can abort an install already in flight. That is the lesser
/// evil: changing the device's identity underneath a running install is
/// incoherent anyway, whereas leaving one of the two evaluators on a stale
/// answer fails later, somewhere else, with an error that does not mention the
/// UDID at all.
