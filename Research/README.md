# Research library

[Project overview](../README.md) · [User documentation](../Documents/README.md)

This directory keeps the evidence behind firmware patches, restore and the self-contained host runtime. **The current public workflow is JB only.** Many notes record earlier experiments and command names; use the [user guides](../Documents/README.md) and `vphone-cli --help` for current instructions.

## Start here

1. [Patch comparison](0_binary_patch_comparison.md) is the canonical per-component inventory. Its regular/dev/exp columns are historical.
2. [Firmware manifest and origins](Firmware/firmware_manifest_and_origins.md) explains the hybrid firmware inputs.
3. [JB kernel patch notes](Kernel/kernel_jb_patch_notes.md) and the [individual patch index](KernelJailbreakPatches/README.md) lead to the kernel evidence.
4. [Native restore design](Restore/native_restore_architecture.md) and [self-contained runtime](Host/runtime_dependency_tiers.md) explain the host migration.

`KernelSymbols/` holds symbol datasets and indexes; `Reference/` holds source references when present. They are evidence inputs, not steps for running the distributed app. The files in `History/` are preserved snapshots and may describe scripts or variants that have since been removed.
